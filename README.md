# Analysis of helminth activation energies

This repo includes data and R scripts for analyzing a compilation of temperature-dependent development rates in parasitic worms (helminths). Temperature dependence is quantified with activation energies and various potential predictors of activation energy are evaluated, including parasite phylogeny, thermal environment, and host characteristics.
