# Analysis of helminth activation energies

This repo includes data and R scripts for analyzing a compilation of temperature-dependent development rates in parasitic worms (helminths). Temperature dependence is quantified with two different temperature performance curves, **Arrhenius** and **Sharpe-Schoolfield**. In both cases, an activation energy is calculated, representing whether development is weakly or strongly temperature dependent. Various potential predictors of activation energy are evaluated, including parasite phylogeny, thermal environment, and host characteristics. Two analyses were conducted, one for **Arrhenius** [here](analyses/06_fit_phylo_models_Arr_Nov4.md) and one for **Sharpe-Schoolfield** [here](analyses/06_fit_phylo_models_SS_Nov4.md).
